# N_Mgmt - v1

## Purpose

This branch and its content is only for history purposes and is not used or maintained.

This was the very first version N_Mgmt.

It was just some kind of php-file-listing with a few options.

The goal was to upload files by ftp and to be able to ( give ) access to it using an internet browser and a password.

There was a need for the table to be sortable and I used sorttable.js for that.
