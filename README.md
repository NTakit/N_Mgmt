# N_Mgmt - v3
## Purpose

I'll upload things here soon…

I'm currently cleanifying my code to be able to share it.

## What's new ?
#### LOT of things !
##### Better coding and folders architecture :
  - Cleaner and easier to modify :
    - One php file = One functionnal part
    - The main core calls the others functionnal parts only if necessary
    - New features can be added faster
    - Dependencies folders should be in the same folder than N_Mgmt
  - Client's JS is now using Ajax requests to make things faster between server and client

##### Complete interface rebuild :
  - Smooth menus
  - Sizeable rows ( 32px to 128px )
  - Choose between images icons or lightweight ( font-Awesome ) icons
  - Easy way to make your own theme
  - Better thumbnails management
  - …

##### New features :
  - Uploaded images can now be Tiny-fied if you've got a TinyPNG account.
  - Ability to download a folder's content as zip
  - Option to do a backup when modifying a file.
  - File backup can be used to see differential modifications
  - Options and users management have been re-thought :
    - Use of .ini files to make things easier
    - More options are available
  - …
