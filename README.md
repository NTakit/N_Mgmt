# N_Mgmt - v2

## Purpose

This branch and its content is only for history purposes and is not used or maintained.

It was a complete rebuild of the very first version, with enchancements and a lot of new features.

The last 2.2 version wasn't updated since July 2014 but is still is use.

## What's new ?

Here are some of the things that were done in the 2.x versions :

( The versions noted are the ones I was using when working on it, it may work or not with more recent ones )

##### Dependencies :
  - Working with jQuery (v2.1.1.min) and prefixfree

##### New features with dependencies :
  - Edition of code with CodeMirror (v4.1)
  - Edition of web pages with TinyMCE (v4.0.26)
  - Uploads management with plupload (v2.1.2), including drag & drop and queeing
  - Color picker with Colpick Color Picker (2013 version)
  
##### Other new features without dependencies :
  - Ability to create new directories or files, rename, move or delete
  - Ability to choose with informations are shown in the table
  - Recycle Bin management
  - Files are used to store informations and modify parameters :
    - Options.txt ( -> List of modifiable things )
    - Users.txt   ( -> List of users/passwords/status )
    - Powers.txt  ( -> List of powers applicable to a "status" )
  - Some other new features were left in the index.php file :
    - Hide specific prefixed files or extensions
    - Mark specific files or directories as read-only ( or copy-only ) for the users


All these enchancements were done in the goal to create some kind of management out of the version 1 which was a "flat list" of directory content.
